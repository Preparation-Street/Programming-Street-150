For those coming from a non-technical background, the world of coding can seem daunting, especially when faced with advanced concepts like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

While DSA is a critical Problem-Solving Skill, it's important to build a strong foundation before diving into it.

**Programming Street - 150** is a collection of 150 curated problems focusing on building foundational programming skills. This collection is divided into three different sprints:

1. **PS-Sprint-1**: This sprint covers fundamental problems to help you build your basic programming skills.

2. **PS-Sprint-2**: This sprint focuses on intermediate-level problems, further strengthening your foundational skills and introducing more complex concepts.

3. **PS-Sprint-3**: This sprint includes advanced problems designed to solidify your understanding and prepare you for more challenging programming tasks.

## The Right Starting Point

1. Select a Programming Language: Begin with a language that suits your interests or industry needs Python, Java, or C++. Focus on mastering the fundamentals: syntax, control structures (loops, conditionals), variables, data types, and other core concepts. 

These are the building blocks of your coding journey.

2. Practice Essential Problems: Once you’ve gained confidence in the basics, it's time to apply your knowledge by solving fundamental programming challenges. Aim to complete at least 100 to 150 exercises, including:
 - Determining Even/Odd Numbers
 - Checking for Prime Numbers
 - Validating Leap Years
 - Calculating Armstrong Numbers
 - Generating the Fibonacci Series
 - Identifying Palindromes
 - Crafting Star Patterns
 - Tackling Basic Mathematical and Logical Problems ( And Many More....... )

These exercises may seem straightforward, but they are crucial for strengthening your understanding of programming logic and syntax. A solid grasp of these fundamentals will provide the stability you need to excel in more complex areas.

I'm curating a list of 150 essential programming problems designed to help you establish a robust foundational skill set. This carefully selected list will be a valuable resource for anyone starting their coding journey, offering a structured path to developing strong, fundamental programming skills.
